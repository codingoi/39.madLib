# Mad Lib for Techies

Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. For this project, weâ€™ll use our knowledge of the HTML form and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!

What you have to do is now make a form capable of collecting the correct information so that the newly crafted story makes sense!
