        <h3>The History of...</h3>
        <!--Original Story-->
        <article id="orig-story">
          <p>There have been many attempts at creating a digital currency during the 90s tech boom, with systems like
            Flooz,
            Beenz and DigiCash emerging on the market but inevitably failing. There were many different reasons for
            their
            failures, such as fraud, financial problems and even frictions between employees and their bosses.</p>

          <p>Notably, all of those systems utilized a Trusted Third Party approach, meaning that the companies behind
            them
            verified and facilitated the transactions. Due to the failures of these companies, the creation of a digital
            cash system was seen as a lost cause for a long while.</p>

          <p>Then, in early 2009, a anonymous programmer or a group of programmers under an alias Satoshi Nakamoto
            introduced Bitcoin. Satoshi described it as a peer2peer electronic cash system. It is completely
            decentralized,
            meaning there are no servers involved and no central controlling authority. The concept closely resembles
            peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.</p>
